4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
   
   All pieces of the assignment are working correctly. I just need to fix how the category images (the positions) are shown in the screen, so 
   the user can choose an image to the category he/she is about to create.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

   I have learned how to use the same pge to create, edit, delete data, controling the behavior of the page 
   by using correct parameters.

6. What is a benefit of having a foreign key constraint?

    The purpose of the foreign key constraint is to enforce referential integrity. 
	Maybe there can be any performance benefit as well.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: 5
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

I have applied the database edit/add/delete within the good looking bootstrap system.
For dates I added datepicker (JQuery) to so the user can pick the dates in the calendar and do not have to write them down.
For the images/icons, I added a select image (JQuery), where the user can choose the images easily.

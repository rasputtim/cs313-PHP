5. Please provide a brief description of what your project does and how to use the application. Make sure to include any required information like a username and password.

	The application provides control over the finances of the user.
	The user can add the financial transactions to the database and group the by categories of incomes, outcomes and informative data. 
	The user can control how are the finances through views of balances.

	HOW TO USE

	username: admin
	password: 123456

	if the user do not log in he can only see institutional pages like contact home and who we are.
	After logging in the user can see the menu options: ADMINISTRATION, TRANSACTIONS, BALANCES

	ADMINISTRATION => allows the user to add/create, list, search and edit categories, views/balances, transactions and options.
	TRANSACTIONS => allows the user to control the financial transactions. this page gives a balance of the total of all transactions listed.
	BALANCES => allows the user to see the balances as they were added in the database. For instance. if the user wants to balance for the period from may 01 to may 15 to be stored, he can add this period 
	in the database and whenever he wants he can check the balance for that period in this page.

	SEARCHES
	The search is case sensitive. so "salary" is different from "Salary" and "salary".
